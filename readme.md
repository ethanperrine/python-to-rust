# Reason Why I am creating this GitHub

A way to get good at coding is to code in the language you are trying to learn.
I am sharing this with you guys so if there are any errors in how I am writing rust or python code, you can make a issue teaching me how to correct it.
Since Python is a very high level language with nearly no learning curve, translating the code to rust should make Rust easier to learn.
